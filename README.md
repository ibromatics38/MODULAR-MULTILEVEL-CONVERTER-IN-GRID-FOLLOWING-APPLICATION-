## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project implements a simplified **MMC prototype** for grid-following applications, retaining core functionalities of traditional MMCs while integrating advanced control systems. Key objectives include:
- Validating energy balancing between converter arms and phases.
- Testing dynamic responses to active/reactive power injections.
- Demonstrating harmonic filtering and voltage stability.
- Simplifying MMC architecture for cost-effective implementation.

**Target Applications**: HVDC transmission, renewable energy integration, and grid stability enhancement.
